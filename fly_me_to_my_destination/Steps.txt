Explaination - 

1. The flyMe function takes an array as input, representing the units of fuel available at each airport. 

2. It iterates through the array, keeping track of the maximum fuel available (maxFuel).

3. If maxFuel becomes zero, it means we cannot reach the current airport with the available fuel, so we hire a new plane and update maxFuel accordingly.

4. The function returns the minimum number of planes required to reach the last airport or -1 if it's not possible to reach the last airport.
